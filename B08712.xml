            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas <hi>Robert Smith</hi> Eſquire, now high Sheriffe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> hath lately received a Writ bearing date the 27. day of May, in the eighteenth yeare of his now Majeſties reigne, thereby commanding him to publiſh a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby all his Maieſties Subjects belonging to the Trained Bands or Militia of this Kingdome, are forbidden to raiſe, March, Muſter, or exerciſe by vertue of any Order or Ordinance, of one or both Houſes of Parliament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent or warrant from his Majeſtie upon paine of puniſhment according to the Lawes. And whereas the ſaid high Sheriffe hath now addreſſed himſelfe to both Houſes of Parliament, for advice and directions therein concerning the ſaid Proclamation to be contrariant and repugnant to the Ordinance and Judgement of both Houſes of Parliament concerning the Militia.</p>
            <p>It is therefore Declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament (they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nothing by the ſaid Ordinance, but the protection and ſecurity of his Majeſties perſon, the defence of the Kingdome againſt Forraigne invaſion, and preſervation of the publike peace againſt inteſtine Rebellions and Inſurrections here at home, the maintenance of the Priviledges and Authority of Parliament according to the proteſtation.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Writ is illegall for that the conſtitution and policy of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="tcp:187833:5"/>
and the King by his Proclamation cannot declare the Law contrary to the reſolution of any of the inferiour Courts of Juſtice, much leſſe againſt the high Court of Parliament. And likewiſe for that this Writ forbiddeth that to be done which they are obliged unto by their duty to God, their allegiance to his Maieſty, and the truſt repoſed in them by the Common-wealth, (the Law having intruſted them to provide for the good and ſafety thereof.) And that the ſaid high Sheriffe hath done nothing in forbearing to publiſh the ſaid proclamation, but according to his duty, and in obedience to the Order of both Houſes. And he is hereby requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to publiſh the ſaid proclamation, or any other proclamations or declarations of the like nature, that concerne the parliament, without firſt acquainting the ſaid Houſes.</p>
            <p>And it is further declared that the ſaid high Sheriffe and other Sheriffes of other Counties within this Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> for their obedience to the orders and ordinances of parliament: Or that have, or hereafter ſhall do any thing in the execution thereof, ſhall be protected by the power and authority of both the ſaid Houſes.</p>

            <p>MY zeale to the peace of this Kingdome, and my apprehentions of our neere approaching miſeries doe cauſe me to ſpeake of the ſubject of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Ki<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gdome exceedes all the Monarchies of <hi>Europe,</hi> both for ſcituation, plenty, rich, comodities, and power both by Sea and Land, continued raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who not onely impeached the Monarchy of <hi>Spaine,</hi> protected the Vnited Provinces, and relieved the <hi>French</hi> in miſerie, but alſo was reverenced by all the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> flouriſhing in the tranquilty of this Kingdom, which which peace proſpered in King <hi>Iames</hi> his Governement, and continued downe to the Raigne of his now Majeſtie, till theſe late unhappy interruptions. Now if in ſtead of this happy condition, wee impartially inquire into the now diſtractions hereof, we ſhall finde ourſelves reduced to the brinke of miſerie. Theſe enemies are not forraign, but of our owne Houſe, ſuch as our jealouſies and diſſentions have raiſed, and civill diſcord is a plentifull Sourſe, from whence all miſeries flow into a Kingdome. Our former diſtempers have growne from the conduct of evill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters invading the ſubjects juſt libertie, and a State is never ſound, till Soveraigne power, and common right are equally ballenced by juſt rules: but the ſickneſſe thereof is rather continued of feares and jealouſies, then out of any reall diſtemper, the King hath condeſcended unto many excellent petitions preſented by many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord, and hath offered to concurre with us in the ſetling all libet<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

We on the other ſide make profeſſion, that we intend to make his Majeſtie a glorious King, to ſupport his Dignity, Regality, and Prerogatives, and to pay uno his that duty, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which by our allegiance, ſeverall Oathes and proteſtations wee owe unto him.</p>
            <p>So that we being both thus reciprocally united, which would make both the King and people happy, ſhall be moſt unfortunate if we ſhall not brtng both incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations together. But it is the greateſt difficulty to compoſe the variances betwixt a King and his people diſ-united: For it is much eaſier to compoſe differences ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from reaſon, yea even from wrongs, then ir is to ſatisfie jealouſies, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the diffidence and diſtruſt will grow upon every occaſion greater, if not removed. Nay mutuall replyes are grown to thoſe direct termes of oppoſition, that they will paſſe farther then verball conteſtations, if not ſtopped. The moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

Countries of Europe have been brought to unexpreſſible calamities by a civill Warre. It is better keeping out of them, then getting out of them, and in a State the wiſdome of prevention is infinitely beyond the wiſedome of Remedies. Nay, if for the ſins of this Nation, Forces and Armies ſhould be mutually raiſed, The very charge of maintaining them would conſume the wealth of the Kingdome: And of this we had lately a coſtly example in thoſe unhappy troubles betwixt us and Scotland, where the keeping of the two Armies coſt this Kingdome a Million of pounds. And if two Armies be once on foot here in England, either a ſuddaine encounter muſt deſtroy one of them, or the keeping them both on foot muſt deſtroy the Kingdome. Let us hearken in moderation to the wiſe advice of our Brethren in Scotland, that all meanes may be forborn, which may make the breach wider, and the wound deeper, that no place be given to the evill Spirit of diviſion, which at ſuch times worketh unceſſantly, and reſteth not: but that the faireſt way be taken by ſo wiſe a King and parliament, as may make his Maieſtie and his poſterity more glorious, and his Kingdome more happy, then ever. The beſt way hereunto in my opinion is, That there may be a ſelect Committee of choiſe perſons of both Houſes, who may reconcile firſt thoſe differences, and then deſcend to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which may be expected from each other, either in point of our ſupporting him, or his relieving us: and laſtly, how all rheſe conditions being agreed upon may be ſo ſecured, as may ſtand with the honour of his Maieſty, and the ſatisfaction of the Subiect. The Ordinance of parliament commandeth all perſons in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to obey it according to the fundamentall Lawes of the Land: The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it to be contrary to the fundamentall Lawes, and commandeth all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects upon their Allegiance not to obey the ſaid Ordinance, as they will anſwer it to their perils. The King commandeth alſo divers of us to attend his perſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are oblidged by our ſeverall ſervices and oathes: in caſe wee comply not with his commands, we are lyable to his diſpleaſure, and the loſſes of thoſe places of honour which we hold under him, if wee obey his Commands without the leave of parliament, we are lyable to the cenſure of parliament, therefore untill it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſſe us with a right underſtanding betwixt the King and the parliament, and a conformity in their commands, neither the Kingdom in publick, nor particular men in private, can be reduced to a ſafe and comfortable condition. And I doubt not (whatſoever ſucceſſe this propoſition may have) it will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the good wiſhes of your Lordſhips, and of all peaceable and well-minded men.</p>
